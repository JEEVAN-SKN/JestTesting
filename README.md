## Internship Exercise 02 
   # Case-sensitive Anagram Checker - Javascript - Jest Testing 

## User Storie:
      -- As a user, I want to check whether two given strings are composed of the same set of case-sensitive characters  and each character can only occur once, so that I can identify case-sensitive anagrams.

## Test Cases explained through user stories: 
   
   TEST CASE I:
          As a user, I want to verify that the function correctly identifies that "listen" and "silent" are not case-sensitive anagrams, so that I can ensure the anagram checker considers character cases.

   TEST CASE II: 
         As a user, I want to validate that the function correctly identifies that "hello" and "world" are not case-sensitive anagrams, so that I can be confident in the accuracy of the anagram checker for different character sets.

   TEST CASE III: 
         As a user, I want to confirm that the function correctly determines that "Astronomer" and "Moon Starer" are not case-sensitive anagrams, so that I can rely on the anagram checker's sensitivity to different cases.

   TEST CASE IV: 
         As a user, I want to ensure that the function correctly identifies that "debit card" and "bad credit" are not case-sensitive anagrams, so that I can trust the anagram checker for multi-word phrases.

   TEST CASE V: 
         As a user, I want to verify that the function handles non-string inputs correctly and returns false when comparing the number 123 with the string "321", so that I can trust the anagram checker with different data types.
